A **generator** in PHP is a special function that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without needing to create an array or store all the values in memory. It generates values on-the-fly, which is useful for handling large datasets or infinite sequences efficiently.

### Simple Example in PHP:

```php
<?php
function generateNumbers($start, $end) {
    for ($i = $start; $i <= $end; $i++) {
        // Yield pauses the function and returns a value
        yield $i;
    }
}

// Using the generator
foreach (generateNumbers(1, 5) as $number) {
    echo $number . " ";
}
?>
```

### Output:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Why Use Generators?
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators don't store all values in memory at once. Instead, they produce values one at a time.
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are generated only when needed, which is useful for large or infinite sequences.
3. **Simpler Code**: You don't need to manually manage arrays or loops for large datasets.

### Example with Large Dataset:
Imagine you need to process a file with millions of lines. Instead of loading the entire file into memory, you can use a generator to process it line by line:

```php
<?php
function readFileLineByLine($file) {
    $handle = fopen($file, 'r');
    while (!feof($handle)) {
        yield fgets($handle); // Yield one line at a time
    }
    fclose($handle);
}

foreach (readFileLineByLine('large_file.txt') as $line) {
    echo $line;
}
?>
```

This approach is memory-efficient and avoids crashing your script due to memory limits.
